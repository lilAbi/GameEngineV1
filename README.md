#GameEngineV1

This project is a 3D Game Engine written in C++ and uses OpenGL as the rendering backend. This game engine uses the Entity-Component System architecture as the backbone structure of the engine for an increase in scalability of sub-systems and multithreading support. This project implements a Greedy Meshing algorithm that efficently generate meshes quickly and using less memory.
